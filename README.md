# Description:

A React app called BPL Dream 11 is used to create a virtual Bangladesh Premier League squad. The Navbar shows the user's initial coin balance of zero, which they can raise by clicking on a banner button. Users can choose between Selected and Available players in the main section. Details such as name, country, role, and price are displayed on each player card. If users have enough coins, they can add players; if not, React-Toastify will provide animated warnings for duplicate selections or insufficient cash. The program has a "Add More Players" button, a newsletter and footer that are well-designed, and an easy way to remove players. The application offers a seamless and engaging experience by carefully adhering to Figma design rules and storing all player data in JSON.
